## Overview

DNDI is an Android framework that makes manage zirks (an Android service using the Bezirk middleware for communication among other services). One can create their own zirk and plug into the framework easily. As for the developer, it provides a simple interface to collect multiple data sources with a single interface.

## Example

### Build a new data preparation Zirk

- Install Android Studio [Android Studio Setup](https://developer.android.com/studio/intro/migrate.html)
- Import the project in Android Studio. 
- Create a new package under ```edu.cmu.msitese.dndiandroid.datagathering``` with the name of the sensor source.
- Create a new Android Service by
 Â  **Right click on the new package created --> New --> Service --> Service**
- This creates a new Java class in the package. Name it as ```[SensorName]Service.java```.
- Implement ```ZirkEndPoint interface``` and ensure the class extends the ```Service class```
- Create a TAG for the class. This helps in logging and debugging later
This can be done by creating a field in the class.
```private static final String TAG = "LocationDataGathrngZirk";```
- Override the ```onCreate()``` method of the service and register the Zirk to the Bezirk Middleware.
Also call the method for listening to events from the ```ZirkManagerService class```, which sends the mode of operation to the respective Zirks.
```JAVA
@Override
public void onCreate() {
    super.onCreate();
    bezirk = BezirkMiddleware.registerZirk("ZIRK_NAME");
    bezirkListener();
}
```
- Implement the ```bezirkListener() method```
```JAVA
public void bezirkListener() {
    eventSet.setEventReceiver(new EventSet.EventReceiver() {
        @Override
        public void receiveEvent(Event event, ZirkEndPoint zirkEndPoint) {
            final CommandEvent commandEvent = (CommandEvent) event;
            CommandEvent.CmdType cmdType = commandEvent.type;
            Log.i(TAG, this.getClass().getName() + "::received" + cmdType);
            //TODO: Implement your code to handle different modes of operation
            
        }
    }
}
```
This method implements handling of the ```CommandEvent``` received by the sensor Zirk from ```ZirkManagerService```
Different flow of execution can be accomodated depending on the type of Mode received by the Zirk. 
- Implement a ```sendMessage() method``` to send Bezirk Events to Normalization Zirks from the Data Gathering Zirk
```Java
public void sendMessage () {
        rawData = new RawData();
        rawData.setLocation(""); //Optional: Can be null
        rawData.setDate(""); //Optional: Can be null
        rawData.setText(""); //Optional: Can be null
        //Create a RawDataEvent with the current mode of operation
        RawDataEvent rawDataEvent = new RawDataEvent(RawDataEvent.GatherMode.BATCH);
        //Pack RawData
        rawDataEvent.appendRawData(rawData);
        event.hasLocation = true;
        event.hasText = true;
        //Send RawDataEvent over Bezirk Middleware to the Normalization Zirk
        bezirk.sendEvent(rawDataEvent);
    }
```
- Open ```ZirkManagerService.java``` in ```../frameworkinterface package```. Add the your Zirk Service class name in the ```private final Class<?>[] services``` field'd declarartion. This field stores the name of the Service classes that need to be started when the framework is started.

### Data model for communication between data gathering and data normalization

[Sai Chandana](https://github.com/SaiHariChandana)

### Implement application callbacks when there is a notification

Any application related events (e.g. KEYWORD\_MATCH, LOCATION\_UPDATE) will be collect by the ZirkManagerService first and forward to the DNDIFramework through broadcast intents. The current version has implemented interfaces for these two events. One just implements the DNDIFrameworkListener interfaces for retrieving these information. If one would like to add more events, one should first declare a new method in the DNDIFrameworkListener and add corresponding code in the broadcast receiver in DNDIFramework. 

```java
// the broadcast receiver callback that parse the intent and call corresponding callback functions
private BroadcastReceiver mBroadcastReceiver = new BroadcastReceiver() {
	@Override
	public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
		
		String result = intent.getStringExtra(RESULT);
		switch (result){
			case KEYWORD_MATCHED:
				ArrayList<String> keywords = intent.getStringArrayListExtra(KEYWORD_MATCHED);
				if(mContext instanceof DNDIFrameworkListener){
					((DNDIFrameworkListener) mContext).onKeywordMatch(keywords);
				}
				break;
			case RAW_LOCATION:
				Location location = intent.getParcelableExtra(RAW_LOCATION);
				if(mContext instanceof DNDIFrameworkListener){
					((DNDIFrameworkListener) mContext).onLastLocationUpdate(location);
				}
				break;
			case ERROR:
			default:
				break;
		}
	}
};
```

With regard to the sender side, one can define one's own intent keys and send through th broadcast intent. The example code below is in the bezirk receiver in ZirkManagerService.

```java
final KeywordMatchEvent keywordMatchEvent = (KeywordMatchEvent) event;
Intent intent = new Intent(ACTION);
intent.putExtra(DNDIFramework.RESULT, DNDIFramework.KEYWORD_MATCHED);
intent.putStringArrayListExtra(DNDIFramework.KEYWORD_MATCHED, keywordMatchEvent.getMatchList());
LocalBroadcastManager.getInstance(getBaseContext()).sendBroadcast(intent);
```

### Define your own event

[Sai Chandana](https://github.com/SaiHariChandana)

specify the rules one has to abide by if one would like to create one's own zirk

### Update the keyword-category map

Keywords are stored in a JSON file as part of the Android application. These are used by the textual normalization
Zirk to compare them with the sensor data feed of the user. The keywords are categorized under a category.

_Sub categories not supported yet by the Text Normalization Zirk_

Create a file called ```keywords.json``` in your Android project.
This can be created under **main/res/raw/keywords.json** folder in the Android project.

You can create multiple entities falling under one broader category of entities

Format of the JSON file

```
[
  {
    "category": "@CATEGORY_NAME_1",
    "keywords": [
      "ENTITY_1",
      "ENTITY_2",
      . . . .
      "ENTITY_N"
    ]
  },
  . . . .
  {
    "category": "@CATEGORY_NAME_2",
    "keywords": [
      "ENTITY_1",
      "ENTITY_2",
      . . . .
      "ENTITY_N"
    ]
  }
]
```

### Test the new components

One may consider testing the new zirk to the framework. One can refer to some androidtest files in the test directory. We illustrate the way how a zirk is tested. 

Each testcase has its own context, so one has to initialize the bezirk middleware everytime. Later, create an object used to notify the waiting main thread. The reason why we implement th testcase in this way is that bezirk requires time for initialization. A TimerTask is required to have a slight delay before starting testing. After having this code structure, one can put the testing logics in the `run()` function overrided by the TimerTask.

```java
@Test(timeout = 30000)
public void testKeywordMatchEvent() throws InterruptedException {
	// initialize the Bezirk service for testing
	BezirkMiddleware.initialize(getContext());
	
	// sync object used to check whether timertask completes before the timeout budget
	final Object syncObject = new Object();
	
	new Timer().schedule(new TimerTask() {
		@Override
		public void run() {
	
			// Bind the service and grab a reference to the binder.
			IBinder binder = bindService(new Intent(getContext(), KeywordMatchService.class));
			assertNotNull(binder);
		
			// Get service instances
			KeywordMatchService service = ((KeywordMatchService.KeywordMatchServiceBinder) binder).getService();
			assertNotNull(service);

			// TODO: add testing logic here
		
			BezirkMiddleware.stop();
			
			synchronized (syncObject) {
				syncObject.notify();
			}
		}
	}, 1000);
	
	// wait for timertask to complete
	synchronized (syncObject) {
		syncObject.wait();
	}
}
```

Although most zirks are running independently and no other activities or services will bind to them, one may still implement the `onBind` method and return a IBinder for testing purpose. The latest Android SDK has provided an anotation for methods that is defined for testing only. One can check the usage of anotation `@VisibleForTesting(otherwise = VisibleForTesting.NONE)`.

### Maintain the lifecycle for resource cleanup and power saving

The communication between ZirkManagerService and a app forground activity is done through Android broadcast intent. The ZirkManagerService gathers information needed for the activity to refresh the GUI components and send it. The DNDIFramework is owned by the main activity so it is in the same memory space as the activity. It registers a broadcast receiver with a particular intent filter to collect intents sent by the ZirkManagerService only.

The application needs the information only when it is running in the foreground, because there is no need to update GUI when running in the background (android service). The following code snippet applies to foreground applicaiton only. If the DNDIFramework instance is owned by a service. It may keep listening to the broadcat intent throughtout the entire lifecycle.

When an applicaiton is removed from the foreground, the `onPause` function is called. When an application is back to the foreground, the `onResume` function is called. Therefore, one may consider override them and call the following methods.

```java
@Override
protected void onResume(){
	super.onResume();
	dndi.resume();
}

@Override
protected void onPause(){
	dndi.pause();
	super.onPause();
}

@Override
protected void onDestroy(){
	dndi.stop();
	super.onDestroy();
}
```

Sometimes, one may have multiple activities in an single application. Each activity may need some information from the DNDIFramework. One can simply instantiate another DNDIFramework and it will bind to the ZirkManagerService, which is design in a singleton pattern.
